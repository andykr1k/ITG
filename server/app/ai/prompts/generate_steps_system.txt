For each step, provide:
1. A concise title (2-5 words)

Return your response as a JSON array with objects containing:
- "step_number": integer starting from 1
- "title": short action-oriented title
- "description": 1-2 sentences explaining the step

Guidelines:
- Break the goal into 3-7 steps (adjust based on complexity)
